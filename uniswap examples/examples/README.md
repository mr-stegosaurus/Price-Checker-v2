# Uniswap Examples

This repository contains example integrations with Uniswap SDK's and various Web3 environments. More detailed guides walking through the core parts of an example can be found on the [Uniswap docs site](https://docs.uniswap.org/). Currently this examples set only covers the [Uniswap V3 SDK](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v3/overview).

## Adding New Examples

To create a new guide, consider starting with an available template. Currently the react template supports core functionality as well as:

- Running against a local copy of mainnet
- Running against a Web3 wallet
- Running against the Ethereum mainnet

Categorize your example by the relevant folder (e.g `v3_sdk/`) and then a folder for the example (e.g `v3_sdk/routing`)
